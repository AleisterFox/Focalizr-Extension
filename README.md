# Extension to enhance web browsing for people with ADHD

This is a browser extension that aims to improve the browsing experience for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The extension is designed to isolate sections of a web page and allow the user to focus on the desired content while blocking out the rest.

## How it works

The extension works by adding a layout to the web page that blocks unwanted content and allows the user to scroll through the desired content with a scroll element that moves with the mouse cursor. The user can choose what type of content they want to see, whether it's text, images, videos, etc. The goal is to enable the user to concentrate on the desired content without distractions, which can be especially useful for those with ADHD.

## How to use

To use this extension, simply download and install it in your web browser. Once installed, the extension will automatically activate on every web page you visit. To isolate a section of the page, simply click on the extension button in the browser toolbar and select the "isolate section" option. Then use the mouse cursor to scroll through the desired content.

## Current project status

The extension is in an early stage of development. Currently, the core functionality of the extension is in place and sections of a web page can be isolated. However, there is still a lot of work to be done to improve functionality and user experience. In the upcoming stages of development, more options for the user will be added, design will be improved, and bugs will be fixed.
